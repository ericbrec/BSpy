class Spline:
    """
    A class to model, represent, and process piecewise polynomial tensor product
    functions (spline functions) as linear combinations of B-splines.  The
    attributes of this class have the following meaning: 

    nInd - the number of independent variables of the spline
    nDep - the number of dependent variables of the spline
    order - a tuple of length nInd where each integer entry represents the
            polynomial order of the function in that variable
    nCoef - a tuple of length nInd where each integer entry represents the
            dimension (i.e. number of B-spline coefficients) of the function
            space in that variable
    knots - a list of the lists of the knots of the spline in each independent
            variable
    coefs - a list of the B-spline coefficients of the spline
    accuracy - each spline function is presumed to be an approximation of
               something else.  This attribute stores the infinity norm error of
               the difference between the given spline function and that
               something else
    metadata - a dictionary of ancillary data to store with the spline
