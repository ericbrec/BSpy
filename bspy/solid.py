        Notes
        -----
        The volume integral is computed by recursive application of the divergence theorem: `volume_integral(divergence(F)) = surface_integral(dot(F, n))`, 
        where `F` is a vector field and `n` is the outward boundary unit normal.
        
        Let `F = [Integral(f) from x0 to x holding other coordinates fixed, 0..0]`. `divergence(F) = f` by construction, and `dot(F, n) = Integral(f) * n[0]`.
        Note that the choice of `x0` is arbitrary as long as it's in the domain of f and doesn't change across all surface integral boundaries.

        Thus, we have `volume_integral(f) = surface_integral(Integral(f) * n[0])`.
        The outward boundary unit normal, `n`, is the cross product of the boundary manifold's tangent space divided by its length.
        The surface differential, `dS`, is the length of cross product of the boundary manifold's tangent space times the differentials of the manifold's domain variables.
        The length of the cross product appears in the numerator and denominator of the surface integral and cancels.
        What's left multiplying `Integral(f)` is the first coordinate of the cross product plus the domain differentials (volume integral).
        The first coordinate of the cross product of the boundary manifold's tangent space is the first cofactor of the tangent space.
        And so, `surface_integral(Integral(f) * n[0]) = volume_integral(Integral(f) * first cofactor)` over each boundary manifold's domain.

        So, we have `volume_integral(f) = volume_integral(Integral(f) * first cofactor)` over each boundary manifold's domain.
        To compute the volume integral we sum `volume_integral` over the domain of the solid's boundaries, using the integrand:
        `scipy.integrate.quad(f, x0, x [other coordinates fixed]) * first cofactor`.
        This recursion continues until the boundaries are only points, where we can just sum the integrand.

        The dimension of the slice is always one less than the dimension of the solid, since the slice is a region in the domain of the manifold slicing the solid.

        To compute the slice of a manifold intersecting the solid, we intersect the manifold with each boundary of the solid. There may be multiple intersections 
        between the manifold and the boundary. Each is either a crossing or a coincident region.

        Crossings result in two intersection manifolds: one in the domain of the manifold and one in the domain of the boundary. By construction, both intersection manifolds have the
        same domain and the same range of the manifold and boundary (the crossing itself). The intersection manifold in the domain of the manifold becomes a boundary of the slice,
        but we must determine the intersection's domain. For that, we slice the boundary's intersection manifold with the boundary's domain. This recursion continues 
        until the slice is just a point with no domain.

        Coincident regions appear in the domains of the manifold and the boundary. We intersect the boundary's coincident region with the domain of the boundary and then map
        it to the domain of the manifold. If the coincident regions have normals in opposite directions, they cancel each other out, so we subtract them from the slice by
        inverting the region and intersecting it with the slice. We use this same technique for removing overlapping coincident regions. If the coincident regions have normals
        in the same direction, we union them with the slice.

        Notes:
        ------
        To intersect two solids, we slice each solid with the boundaries of the other solid. The slices are the region
        of the domain that intersect the solid. We then intersect the domain of each boundary with its slice of the other solid. Thus,
        the intersection of two solids becomes a set of intersections within the domains of their boundaries. This recursion continues
        until we are intersecting points whose domains have no boundaries.

        The only subtlety is when two boundaries are coincident. To avoid overlapping the coincident region, we keep that region
        for one slice and trim it away for the other. We use a manifold intersection cache to keep track of these pairs, as well as to reduce computation.
